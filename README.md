# **EasyTinyML: An Automated TinyML Model Deployment Platform**

![EasyTinyML Logo](path/to/your/image.png)  
*Seamlessly deploy TinyML models on microcontrollers with minimal effort.*

---

## **Overview**  
**EasyTinyML** automates the deployment of TinyML models. Users can upload trained `.h5` models, which are converted to TinyML formats for embedding on microcontrollers. The platform also supports model training directly through its web interface, simplifying the workflow from training to deployment.

---

## **Features**  
- **Automated Model Conversion:**  
  Convert `.h5` models to TinyML-compatible formats automatically.

- **Quick Model Training:**  
  Train object detection models directly on the platform.

- **Simplified Deployment:**  
  Deploy models on microcontrollers without using complex IDEs like Arduino.

- **User-Friendly GUI:**  
  Manage model uploads, conversions, and deployments easily via the interface.

---

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**
- **Python 3.x**  
- Required libraries specified in `requirements.txt`

---

### **Installation and Usage**

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/EasyTinyML.git
   cd EasyTinyML
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   - This command launches the **EasyTinyML** platform locally.  
   - Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` to access the web interface.

4. **Note:**  
   The platform dynamically generates required files (such as configuration scripts, conversion outputs, and deployment files) based on the userâ€™s uploaded models and inputs.

---

## **Workflow**  
1. **Upload Model:**  
   Upload your `.h5` file through the web interface.  

2. **Select MCU:**  
   Choose your microcontroller from the list of supported devices.  

3. **Deploy:**  
   Download the generated code and upload it to your microcontroller for deployment.
