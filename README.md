*Simplify your journey from trained models to microcontroller deployment.*

---

## **Overview**  
**EasyTinyML** is a web-based platform designed to automate the deployment of TinyML models on microcontrollers. Users can upload trained machine learning models as `.h5` files, which are automatically converted to a format suitable for TinyML deployment. The platform also supports direct training of object detection models, enabling seamless deployment on MCU targets without the need for manual programming in IDEs like Arduino.
